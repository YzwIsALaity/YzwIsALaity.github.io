          I am <b>Yongzhe</b> and a biostatistician from the <a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/research" style="text-decoration: none;">City of Hope</a> 
	  with a passion for clinical and biomedical studies. 
          I am very passionate about data visualization and believe that it is a powerful tool for communicating complex information in a way 
	  that is accessible to a wide range of audience.

	 <h2>Where I learned my skills...</h2>
    	 <p style="font-size:20px">
	    Before I joined in the City of Hope, I earned my Master of Science in biostatistics from the University of Washington, Department of Biostatistics in 2022, 
	    where I had the privilege of being advised by James Hughes and Helen Chu. During my time there, I actively participated in numerous research projects focused 
	    on combating the COVID-19 pandemic, spanning from observational studies to molecular investigations. 
	    Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor of Science in statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2020. At UCLA, 
	    I developed a keen interest in applying advanced machine learning models to gain insights into the behavior of concrete and cement, aiming to mitigate carbon emissions. 
	    I was fortunate to receive guidance from Mathieu Bauchy, who supported me in exploring this fascinating area of research.
