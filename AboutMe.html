          I am <b>Yongzhe</b> and a biostatistician from the <a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/research" style="text-decoration: none;">City of Hope</a> 
	  with a passion for clinical and biomedical studies. 
          I am very passionate about data visualization and believe that it is a powerful tool for communicating complex information in a way 
	  that is accessible to a wide range of audience.

	 <h2>Where I learned my skills...</h2>
    	 <p style="font-size:20px">
	    Before I joined in the City of Hope, I earned my <b>Master of Science in biostatistics from the University of Washington (2022)</b>, 
	    where I had the privilege of being advised by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jphughes/" style="text-decoration: none;">Jim Hughes</a> and 
	    <a href="https://www.chulab.org/people" style="text-decoration: none;">Helen Y. Chu</a>. 
	    During my time there, I actively participated in numerous research projects focused on combating the COVID-19 pandemic, spanning from 
	    observational studies to molecular investigations. 
	    Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my <b>Bachelor of Science in statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles (2020)</b>. At UCLA, 
	    I developed a keen interest in applying advanced machine learning models to gain insights into the behavior of concrete and cement, aiming to mitigate carbon emissions. 
	    I was fortunate to receive guidance from <a href="https://www.lab-paris.com/?page_id=328" style="text-decoration: none;">Mathieu Bauchy</a> and 
	    <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~hqxu/" style="text-decoration: none;">Hongquan Xu</a>, who supported me in exploring this fascinating area of research.
