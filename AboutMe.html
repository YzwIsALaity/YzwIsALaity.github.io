          I am <b>Yongzhe 永哲</b> :) and a biostatistician from the <a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/research" style="text-decoration: none;">City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> 
	  with a passion for clinical and biomedical studies. 
          I am very passionate about data visualization and believe that it is a powerful tool for communicating complex information in a way 
	  that is accessible to a wide range of audience.

	 <h2>Where I learned my skills...</h2>
    	 <p style="font-size:16px">
	    Before I joined in the City of Hope, I earned my <b><i>Master of Science in biostatistics from the University of Washington (2022)</i></b>, 
	    where I had the privilege of being advised by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jphughes/" style="text-decoration: none;">Jim Hughes</a> and 
	    <a href="https://www.chulab.org/people" style="text-decoration: none;">Helen Y. Chu</a>. 
	    During my time there, I actively participated in numerous research <b>focused on combating the COVID-19 pandemic, spanning from 
	    epidemiological studies (i.e., case control, cohort, disease incidence) to molecular (i.e., cytokine, metabolomics, preoteomics) investigations</b>. 
	    Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my <b><i>Bachelor of Science in statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles (2020)</i></b>. At UCLA, 
	    I developed a keen <b>interest in applying advanced machine learning models to gain insights into the behavior of concrete and cement, aiming to mitigate carbon emissions</b>. 
	    I was fortunate to receive guidance from <a href="https://www.lab-paris.com/?page_id=328" style="text-decoration: none;">Mathieu Bauchy</a> and 
	    <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~hqxu/" style="text-decoration: none;">Hongquan Xu</a>, who supported me in exploring this fascinating area of research.

	 <h2>What I am doing now...</h2>
	 <p style="font-size:16px">
	    I worked as a biostatistician at the City of Hope, focusing primarily on <b>research related to women's cancers such as gynecologic cancer, 
	    breast cancer, and colorectal cancer</b>. My goal was to <b>investigate the disparities in cancer behavior based on various social determinants, 
	    such as race/ethnicity and insurance, as well as biological and molecular information, including genomics, proteomics, and cytokines</b>. 
	    Additionally, I evaluated programs/trials aimed at translating scientific knowledge into community practice to reduce and eliminate inequalities 
	    in cancer outcomes. In my daily work, I frequently addressed questions like:
		 
	    <ul style="font-size:16px">
  		<li>Are there disparities in cervical cancer survival rates among different race/ethnicity groups?</li>
  		<li>Which mRNA expressions are highly associated with cancer behavior, and could they serve as new biomarkers?</li>
  		<li>Does the cancer intervention effectively reduce patients' burdens and improve diagnosis?</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p style="font-size:16px">
	    Similar cancer-related problems often arose in my work. Regardless of the specific question, statistical analysis played a crucial role in 
	    providing evidence to answer scientific inquiries. <b>I employed various statistical methods, such as survival and longitudinal models, 
	    machine learning, experimental designs, and many other statistical models, integrating them to formulate effective solution pathways for each scientific question.</b> 
	    In addition to my cancer-related research, I also <b>conduct statistical analysis in computational neuroscience to explore the relationship 
	    between neuro signals and animal behaviors</b>.

	 <h2>What I am interested…</h2>
	 <p style="font-size:16px">
	   My research journey began with the application of <b>variable importance</b>, such as <b>permutation importance and Shapley values</b>, to investigate 
	   the impact of chemical compositions on the strength of concrete/cement. This experience sparked my interest in exploring <b>variable importance for 
	   both semi-parametric and non-parametric models</b>. As I delved into <b>high-dimensional data from respiratory infectious diseases and cancer studies</b>, 
	   which included RNA-seq, proteomics, and cytokine data, I became fascinated with understanding how variable importance can be incorporated into statistical 
	   models for such data types. Given the longitudinal nature and survival-related aspects of clinical and biomedical studies, I developed a specific 
	   interest in utilizing <b>longitudinal and survival models</b> to effectively handle high-dimensional data in practical scenarios. As I immersed myself in 
	   public health studies, I regularly encountered data analysis related to <b>population science and implementation science</b>. I was intrigued by the prospect of 
	   adapting statistical models to accommodate data from diverse study designs and answer scientific inquiries. Regardless of the aforementioned research 
	   questions, I strongly believe that <b>data visualization</b> plays an integral role in explanatory data analysis. As a biostatistician, I am consistently passionate 
	   about enhancing data visualization techniques to suit various types of data.
