I am Yongzhe and a biostatistician with a passion for clinical and observational studies. I work on biomarker discovery and precision medicine for women's cancer. I am very passionate about data visualization and believe that it is a powerful tool for communicating complex information in a way that is accessible to a wide range of stakeholders.
